# Study of the flagellar movement in biology with applications in MEMS and micro robotics

## Introduction
The theme is essentially a research topic specific to the field of bionics. That is, an approach based on biological research with specific technical or engineering results.
Thus, the research approach algorithm will include the detailed study of the microbiological structure of flagellates with weight on the microsystem of movement represented by flagellum. Continuing with simple static, cinematic or dynamic models, a study is made on various types of existing electromechanical actuators based on conventional or unconventional drivers;
- Electromagnetic microactuators; 
- Micro-motors D.C. or A.C.
- Piezoelectric actuation
- Electrostrictive actuation,
- Electrodynamic actuation,
- Magnetostrictive actuation,
			
The study of these types of actuators will be made comparative in the idea that priorities are set in the realization of primary experimental models which after laboratory experiments will have special actuation performances; speeds, accelerations, etc.
It then returns to the optimization of the initial (or primary) microelectromechanical models, eventually reaching patentation of calculation and design. On this basis, several optimized experimental models will be built.
For achieving experiments, experimental protocols and small specific stands will be established, such as; hydrodynamic micro-tunes, micro dynamometer measuring systems to determine fluid forwarding forces, micro frequency, forward, flotation, etc.
The last chapter is dedicated to dissemination, research in the sense of finalizing published or communicated scientific works, or the completion of some patent proposals, adding new research topics, starting from the present research, according to the scientific spirit (see Bachelard) to continue a research.
